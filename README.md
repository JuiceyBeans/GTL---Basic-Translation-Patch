This is a "Translation" Patch for the Modpack called GTL -> https://github.com/nutant233/GregTech-Leisure -> https://www.mcmod.cn/modpack/769.html -> id advise to "download" the pack via the github and get that up working as an instance in Prism or whichever Launcher of your choosing and then apply this Patch afterwards.

The Pack is based on Chinese and sadly alot of it was baked into non language files. Also there is still remaining Chinese tooltips since they sadly ship a custom Jar of GTCEU Modern with changed files and added java classes to make this pack work. Aka you cant just update this pack yourself.
